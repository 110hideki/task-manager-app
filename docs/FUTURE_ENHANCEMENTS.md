# Future Enhancements

This document outlines potential improvements and features for future phases of the Task Manager application.

## Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization

### Priority: Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Features:**
- User registration and login
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session management with Flask-Login
- User-specific task lists
- Profile management

**Technical Requirements:**
- Add `users` collection to MongoDB
- Add `user_id` field to tasks
- Implement Flask-Login for session management
- Add Redis for distributed session storage (Kubernetes)
- Create login/register templates

**Kubernetes Considerations:**
- Deploy Redis as StatefulSet or use managed Redis
- Configure session affinity or shared session store
- Update health checks to include authentication

### Security Hardening
- Enable CSRF protection
- Add rate limiting
- Implement security headers
- Regular security scanning
- Vulnerability management

### Disaster Recovery

## Current Focus: Infrastructure & Deployment

For the CNAP tech exercise, we focus on:
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment
- ✅ Container orchestration
- ✅ Cloud provider integration (AWS/GCP)
- ✅ Load balancing
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Monitoring basics
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline

Authentication and advanced features are intentionally deferred to keep the infrastructure demo simple and focused.
