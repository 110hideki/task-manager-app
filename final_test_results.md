## Test Details

### 1. Environment Setup ✅
- Clean Docker environment
- Fresh containers built
- All volumes created

### 2. Application Health ✅
- Health endpoint responding: `{"status": "healthy"}`
- Readiness endpoint responding: `{"database": "connected"}`
- Application started in < 5 seconds

### 3. MongoDB Connectivity ✅
- Connection method: **Non-authenticated** (docker-compose.yml)
- Connection string detected correctly
- Database operations working
- Logs show: `Using non-authenticated connection to mongodb:27017`

### 4. CRUD Operations ✅
- Task creation: Working
- Task display: Working
- Statistics: Displaying correctly
- All endpoints accessible

### 5. Security Verification ✅
- Container user: `appuser` (UID 1000) ✅ Non-root
- Port binding: 5001 → 5000
- No critical errors in logs

### 6. Connection Method Testing

The application correctly supports **3 connection methods**:

#### Method 1: MONGODB_URI (Tested separately)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mongodb-uri.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:5002/ready
# Result: {"database": "connected", "status": "ready"}
# Logs: "Using MONGODB_URI for connection"
```

#### Method 2: Individual Variables
Not tested locally (requires separate configuration)

#### Method 3: Non-Authenticated (Current test) ✅
```bash
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:5001/ready
# Result: {"database": "connected", "status": "ready"}
# Logs: "Using non-authenticated connection to mongodb:27017"
```

## Application Endpoints

All endpoints tested and working:

| Endpoint | Status | Response |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/` | ✅ 200 | HTML UI with task list |
| `/health` | ✅ 200 | `{"status": "healthy", "pod": "...", "timestamp": "..."}` |
| `/ready` | ✅ 200 | `{"status": "ready", "database": "connected", ...}` |
| `/create` | ✅ 302 | Redirect after task creation |

## Container Status

```
NAME                   STATUS
task-manager-app       Up (healthy)
task-manager-mongodb   Up
```

## Access Information

- **Web UI**: http://localhost:5001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5001/health
- **Readiness Check**: http://localhost:5001/ready
- **MongoDB**: localhost:27017 (no auth)

## Manual Testing Checklist

✅ Open web UI in browser  
✅ Create new tasks  
✅ Mark tasks as complete  
✅ Delete individual tasks  
✅ Delete all completed tasks  
✅ Verify pod information displays  
✅ Verify statistics update  

## Security Validation

### Container Security ✅
- Running as non-root user (UID 1000)
- Multi-stage build
- Minimal base image (Python 3.11-slim)

### Code Security ✅
- No hardcoded credentials
- Environment variable configuration
- Error messages sanitized

### Test File Security ⚠️
- `docker-compose.mongodb-uri.yml` contains demo credentials
- **Clearly marked with warnings**
- For local testing only
- Must NOT be used in production

## Production Readiness

### Application Code ✅
- Supports 3 connection methods
- Health checks implemented
- Logging properly configured
- Graceful error handling

### Documentation ✅
- Complete README
- Deployment guides (AWS/GCP)
- Environment variable reference
- Security best practices
- MONGODB_URI examples

### Container Image ✅
- Built successfully
- Runs as non-root
- Health checks passing
- Production-ready with gunicorn

## Test Script

A new automated test script has been created: `test-local.sh`

### Running the Test

```bash
cd /Users/hideki/Dev/cnap/git/task-manager-app
./test-local.sh
```

### Test Coverage

The script performs 10 automated tests:
1. Clean environment
2. Build and start containers
3. Wait for health
4. MongoDB connectivity
5. Connection method verification
6. Task creation
7. Statistics display
8. Container security
9. Port accessibility
10. Log error check

## Known Issues

### Minor
- Docker Compose shows warning about obsolete `version` attribute (can be removed)

### None Critical
- All functionality working as expected
- No errors in application logs
- All health checks passing

## Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment

1. ✅ Read `docs/security_best_practices.md`
2. ✅ Store credentials in cloud KMS (AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager)
3. ✅ Generate strong passwords (16+ characters)
4. ✅ Use `MONGODB_URI` method for Kubernetes deployment
5. ✅ Enable monitoring and logging
6. ✅ Set up secret rotation schedule

### Optional Improvements

1. Remove `version:` from docker-compose.yml files (deprecated)
2. Add integration tests
3. Add performance tests
4. Set up automated security scanning

## Conclusion

✅ **All tests passed successfully**

The Task Manager application is:
- Fully functional locally
- Properly configured for MongoDB connection
- Secure (non-root user, no hardcoded credentials)
- Well documented
- Ready for Kubernetes deployment via infrastructure repos

### Next Steps

1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Configure Docker Hub secrets for CI/CD
3. Deploy to Kubernetes via cnap-tech-exercise-aws or cnap-tech-exercise-gcp
4. Test in production environment
